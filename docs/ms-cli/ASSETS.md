# Assets (Icons / Fonts)

Icon pipeline:

- SVG cleaned by Inkscape
- Glyph font generated by FontForge (TTF)
- LVGL binary fonts generated by `lv_font_conv`

## Required system tools

- Inkscape: https://inkscape.org/release/1.4.3/platforms/
- FontForge: https://fontforge.org/en-US/downloads/

## JS runtime

- Bun is preferred (`bunx`)
- Node.js is a fallback (`npx`)

`lv_font_conv` version is pinned via `LV_FONT_CONV_VERSION` in each `icon_converter.conf`.

## Commands

```bash
ms icons core
ms icons bitwig
```

These run `open-control/ui-lvgl-cli-tools/icon/build.py` inside each PlatformIO project.
