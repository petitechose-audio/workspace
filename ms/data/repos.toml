# Pinned repository manifest for the workspace.
#
# Phase 3 goal: repo sync works with `git` only (no `gh`, no GH auth).
# This file defines *which* repos exist and *where* they are cloned.
#
# Notes:
# - We keep the set minimal but complete for dev (core + bitwig):
#   - Teensy firmware builds use local open-control libs via PlatformIO symlinks.
#   - SDL native/wasm builds use additional open-control HAL repos.
#   - Bitwig protocol generation uses open-control/protocol-codegen.
